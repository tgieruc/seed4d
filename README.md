Models for egocentric 3D and 4D reconstruction, including few-shot interpolation and extrapolation settings, can benefit from having images from exocentric viewpoints as supervision signals. No existing dataset provides the necessary mixture of complex, dynamic, and multi-view data. To facilitate the development of 3D and 4D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving context, we propose a Synthetic Ego--Exo Dynamic 4D (SEED4D) dataset. We here provide the code with which we generated the data.

Our data generator is build on [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) and can generator synthetic egocentrical views similar to the camera setup in [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes), [KITTI360](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti-360/) or [Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/) and simultaneously create create exocentrical views. Resulting poses are outputted in a [Nerfstudio suitable data format](https://docs.nerf.studio/quickstart/data_conventions.html).
